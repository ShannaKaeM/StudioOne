# DOCS Plugin Features Audit

## Overview
The DOCS plugin has evolved from a WordPress-based documentation and agent system to a file-based documentation management system integrated into the Studio ONE platform.

## Core Features Identified

### 1. File-Based Documentation System
**Status: Implemented**
- **DocsPage Component** (`src/pages/DocsPage.tsx`)
  - File browser interface for markdown/text documents
  - Real-time editing capabilities
  - Auto-save functionality
  - File system storage in `guardian-data/docs/`

### 2. Documentation Management
**Current Implementation:**
- **List View**: Display all documentation files
- **Editor**: In-browser text editor with monospace font
- **Save Functionality**: Direct file system writes
- **Navigation**: Simple file selection interface

### 3. Storage Integration
- Uses file system adapters (`storage-fs`)
- Documents stored as plain text/markdown files
- Git-friendly format for version control
- No database dependency

## Legacy Features (From Documentation)

### Previous WordPress Implementation:
1. **Agent System**
   - AI-powered documentation assistants
   - Context-aware help system
   - Integration with WordPress post types

2. **Collaboration Features**
   - Multi-user documentation editing
   - Version control within WordPress
   - Comment and revision system

3. **WordPress Integration**
   - Custom post types for docs
   - WordPress editor integration
   - Theme documentation hooks

## Current Architecture

```
DocsPage
├── File List Component
│   └── File selection buttons
├── Editor Component
│   ├── Textarea for content
│   └── Save functionality
└── Storage Adapter
    ├── getDocsList()
    ├── getDoc()
    └── saveDoc()
```

## Key Changes from Legacy

1. **Storage Model**
   - From: WordPress database (CPTs)
   - To: File system (markdown/text files)

2. **Editor**
   - From: WordPress block editor
   - To: Simple textarea with direct editing

3. **Agent System**
   - From: Active AI assistants
   - To: Moved to Guardian's advisory system

4. **Collaboration**
   - From: WordPress user system
   - To: Git-based collaboration

## Integration Points

### Guardian Integration:
- Docs can be linked to nodes and agents
- Documentation for governance rules
- Advisory documentation support

### Studio ONE Integration:
- Unified documentation system
- Shared storage adapters
- Common UI components

## Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Core functions from DocsPage
- getDocsList(): Promise<string[]>     // List all docs
- getDoc(name): Promise<string>        // Read doc content
- saveDoc(name, content): Promise<void> // Save doc content
```

## Features Summary

### What's Working:
1. ✅ File-based document storage
2. ✅ Simple editing interface
3. ✅ Git-friendly storage format
4. ✅ Integration with Guardian data structure

### What's Missing (from legacy):
1. ❌ AI-powered agents
2. ❌ Rich text editing
3. ❌ WordPress integration
4. ❌ Advanced collaboration features

## Recommendations

1. **Rich Editor**: Consider adding markdown preview/editing
2. **Search**: Implement document search functionality
3. **Categories**: Add document organization/tagging
4. **Linking**: Better integration with nodes/advisories
5. **Agent Revival**: Reintroduce AI assistance in modern form

## Summary

The DOCS plugin has been simplified from a complex WordPress-integrated system to a straightforward file-based documentation manager. While it loses some advanced features like AI agents and rich editing, it gains simplicity, portability, and Git-friendliness. The current implementation serves as a solid foundation for documentation within the Studio ONE ecosystem.
